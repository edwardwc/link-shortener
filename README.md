# swath.cc link shortener
It's a small link shortener (in Rust)!

This is my first project in Rust :)

Frontend is in NextJS, backend uses Sled, Salvo and Tokio.

Running the code:
```aidl
git clone https://github.com/edwardwc/link-shortener
cd link-shortener
cargo run --release # for release builds
./target/release/link-shortener
```
